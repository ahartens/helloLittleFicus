	1) I don't think my similarity matrix is a similarity matrix at all. it's a distance matrix..
	want to either take :
	- the inner product (dot product)
	- Pearson Correlation Coefficient : dot product of standardized (ie. centered on their means + scaled by stdev) 

	2) about confusion of yesterday : in book says about kmeans clustering that a proximity matrix isn't needed... so i just feed it the raw (ie. normalized) data?

	3) from tibshirani "estimating the number of clusters in a data set via the gap statistic"

		- NOW TOTALLY CONFUSED. how does one cluster pairwise distances? researching spectral clustering, k mediod apparently, kernel kmeans..huh?


		- added clustering directory parallel to matrix (as well as tests)
		- added kmeans class. as it stands, kmeans can be relatively subclassed easily
		- major question :
				do i want each part of kmeans to be a different class? for example, should 
				1) calculating k (later gapstat)
				2) cluster initialization
				3) calculating distance from cluster center
				4) recalculating mean
				all be a separate classes, so that a very basic kmeans calls modular parts
		as it is now, the entire kmeans class can be subclassed and the parts that one wishes to change can be simply overridden.. but doesn't seem too elegant. hm...

		- removed mean normalization + feature scaling : these will be done prior to starting program (matlab, r)
		- made similarity matrix more efficient (is now a diagonal)

12. January 2015

		believe I added a similarity matrix based on euclidian distance
		- subclass of 'matrix' object
		- calls 'super.setMatrix' in constructor method

		Now :
		- mean normalization? 

		Still to do:
		- hard coded test of dotproduct

		reading about interface
		suggestion was have a 'matrix' interface which both the data matrix and similarity matrix implement seems counterintuitive; i would have to implement methods twice eg. copy and paste matrix multiplication into both classes (these calculations remain identical) . why not just have 'dataMatrix' and 'similarityMatrix' be subclasses of matrix

		if do wish to have matrix calculations be declared in interface such as 'Computable' which declares functions such as 'multiply' and 'inverse' (adhering to interfaces as adjectives and classes has nouns) seems more plausable.. but why do this? Do we intend to :
		1) create matrices that don't implement matrix calculations?
		2) have non matrix classes implement matrix calculations?

		maybe i didn't understand suggestion.

		or.. maybe interface is just there to declare methods as api so that eg. in cluster analysis I know what can be done with matrix object


		OR : have Matrix interface , then Matrixcalculations class that implements them
		- further matrix objects such as 'Datatable' and 'Similaritymatrix' have an object Matrixcalculations that can implement methods.. 


		--> downloaded human brain ontology used by allen brain project.
		1) should keep data in a dictionary, with 'id' as key and 'structure object' as value? each structure object has a 'parent_id' field and an array of children?
		or 2) have each structure have an array of parents and

		1) Added matrix matrix multiplication and some unit testing : same as transposition, how thoroughly shoudl results be tested? with matrix of known answer? pos/neg/zero values?
		2) Added matrix scalar multiplication and some unit testing :
		Questions : 
		- how thoroughly is unit testing reasonable? With pre-defined answers, or perform parallel operation and check results? 
		- should i check for null argument at every step ?

		1) added addition method to matrix, and corressponding unit testing
		2) simple transpostion, copying values into new empty matrix : INEFFICIENT! in situs transposition for square matrices
		**how should one unit test for transposition??
